# ScanMint

![ScanMint banner](assets/scanmint-banner.png)

A mobile document scanner that detects, corrects perspective, and classifies document images using computer vision and deep learning. Built for CSCI435 at the University of Wollongong in Dubai.

**Current version: v0.16**

this project gave me a headache and major burn out. im also convinced that no one is ever, and i mean EVER, going to read this md file, but if you will, i added a dog. scroll to the bottom. *wink wink*.

## What it does

1. **Scan** — detects the document boundary in a photo using a five-pass Canny/HSV/Otsu cascade, applies a perspective transform, binarises the result into a clean scan, and identifies text regions.
2. **Classify** — runs the corrected image through a MobileNetV2 model to label it as one of: `handwritten`, `invoice`, `form`, or `printed_page`.
3. **Organise** — stores scan history locally, lets users save and folder-organise results, filter by category, and download scans to device.
4. **Feedback** — after each classification, prompts the user to confirm or correct the predicted label. Responses are stored in Supabase (with `user_id` when signed in, anonymous otherwise) and mirrored to localStorage as a backup.

## Project structure

(semi accurate, its a little messier in practice since i decided we need a redesign. major redesign. of everything. )

## Running the demo locally

You need three terminals, one per service. Start them in this order. *or else*

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.9+** — `python3 --version`
- **Node.js 18+** — `node --version`
- **The model weights file** — `document_classifier_v2.pt` is not in git. Get it from the google drive pls and place it in `classifier/`.

If there are any questions or u can't find a file, pls don't hesitate to reach out and email mb631@uowmail.edu.au or any other group members email.(although me, personally, I am horrible at reading and replying to emails, so expect a delay.)

### 1 — Backend (CV pipeline) port 8000

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        #windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
ps: i swiched to mac a few days ago and now I have the priviledge of writing for both windows and mac ;p
if i start using linux eventually, we can say ive collected all the infinity stones. 

Health check: [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health) → `{"status":"ok"}`

---

### 2 — Classifier port 8001

```bash
cd classifier
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8001
```

> `torch` and `torchvision` are large (~1 GB). First install takes a few minutes.

Health check: [http://localhost:8001/health](http://localhost:8001/health) → `{"status":"ok"}`

---

### 3 — Frontend port 3000

Create `frontend/.env.local` (gitignored — create manually):

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SCAN_API=http://localhost:8000
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLASSIFY_API=http://localhost:8001
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://<your-project>.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-anon-key>
```

Then:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

> **Camera on phone:** `getUserMedia` requires HTTPS outside of localhost. Use `npm run dev -- --hostname 0.0.0.0` and open `http://<your-laptop-ip>:3000` on your phone, but the camera button won't work without HTTPS — use "Upload Image" for phone testing instead.

---

## Supabase setup

The app uses Supabase for:
- **Feedback storage** — classification feedback is inserted into the `feedback` table
- **Authentication** — optional email + password login (Supabase Auth)

To apply the database migration, run:

```bash
supabase db push
```

Or paste each file in `supabase/migrations/` into the Supabase dashboard SQL editor in order.

Users are **not required to log in** — all features (scan, classify, history, folders, feedback) work fully as a guest. When signed in, `user_id` is attached to feedback rows. When not signed in, `user_id` is `null`.

---

## Model weights

`document_classifier_v2.pt` is gitignored. The training notebook is at `classifier/csci435_version1.ipynb`. Place the `.pt` file in `classifier/` before starting the classifier service.

The training pipeline uses MobileNetV2 with augmentation: random flips, rotation, colour jitter, affine shear, Gaussian blur, and random erasing — tuned to simulate real-world handheld document photos.

## Datasets & Licensing

This project uses two datasets for training the core classifier, neither of which is redistributed in this repository:

- **senju14 OCR Dataset of Multi-type Documents** (Kaggle) — licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. Used strictly for non-commercial academic purposes as part of a university coursework project.
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/senju14/ocr-dataset-of-multi-type-documents

- **suvroo Scanned Images Dataset for OCR and VLM Finetuning** (Kaggle).
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suvroo/scanned-images-dataset-for-ocr-and-vlm-finetuning

The deployed classifier (`document_classifier_v2.pt`, 4 classes: `handwritten`, `invoice`, `form`, `printed_page`) was trained using the senju14 dataset, which is licensed CC BY-NC-SA 4.0. As a result, this trained model is provided for non-commercial academic use only, consistent with the source dataset's license terms.

This project itself (the application code) is licensed under MIT — see [LICENSE](LICENSE). The MIT license applies to our original code only, not to the third-party datasets or trained model weights, which remain subject to their own license terms as noted above.

## Version history

| Version | Feature |
|---------|---------|
| v0.16 | Edge support validation in document detection: rejects quads where any side lacks real Canny edges (catches occlusion bridging from overlapping objects); pass 4 erode/restore logic for overlapping white documents; tighter polygon approximation epsilons |
| v0.15 | Feedback image storage: warped image uploaded to Supabase Storage alongside each feedback row; export_corrections.py script for retraining data export; logo and icon refresh |
| v0.14 | Removed deskew step from CV pipeline — perspective correction already produces near-straight output |
| v0.13 | Upload security hardening on /scan and /classify: MIME + magic-byte validation, 10 MB size limit, dimension cap, generic error responses |
| v0.12 | Optional Supabase Auth (email + password, guest-first); CHECK constraints on feedback label columns |
| v0.11 | Classification feedback prompt (Supabase + localStorage dual-write) |
| v0.10 | Folder system in Saved screen, All Scans default folder |
| v0.9  | Default scan quality setting (Low / Medium / High) |
| v0.8  | Category filters, Save to Device, improved thumbnails |
| v0.7  | Deskewing step in CV pipeline |
| v0.6  | Local scan history and Settings screen |
| v0.5  | Region segmentation overlay |
| v0.4  | Document classifier (MobileNetV2) |
| v0.3  | Perspective transform + binarisation |
